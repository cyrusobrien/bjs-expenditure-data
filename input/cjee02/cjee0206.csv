Notes: March payroll data may not sum to total because of rounding.
Local government data are estimates subject to variability.
"a/ Total March payroll includes payrolls of States and all types of local governments including independent school districts,"
"which are not displayed separately.  The ""Local, total"" lines, which include these districts, will not equal the sum of the"
" ""Counties"" and ""Municipalities"" lines."
b/ Justice system payrolls of independent school districts and special districts (primarily for special police forces) are not
available.
