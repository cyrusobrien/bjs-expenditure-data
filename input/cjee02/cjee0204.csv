Notes:  Local government data are estimates subject to variability.
"a/ For each State and the United States summary, the expenditure figures shown on the ""Local, total"" lines and the combined State-local total lines (opposite each State's name) exclude duplicative intergovernmental transactions."
"Thus, the ""Local, total"" lines include intergovernmental payments only to the State government and the combined State-local total lines exclude all intergovernmental payments."
