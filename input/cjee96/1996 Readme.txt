1996 JUSTICE EXPENDITURE AND EMPLOYMENT EXTRACTS PROGRAM																	
CJEE EXTRACTS																	
NCJ 180883																	
																	
This zip archive contains tables in individual .wk1 spreadsheets 
from the 1996 Justice Expenditure and Employment Extracts (CJEE 
Extracts) and .txt files providing supporting documentation. The 
1996 empoloyment data are identical to the 1995 (some of which have 
been revised) because of methodoloigcal changes at the Census Bureau. 
Whereas prior to 1996 the reference month for the employment data was 
October of each year, subsequent to 1996 the reference month will be 
March. Consequently October 1996 employment data were not collected.
