"a/ For each state and the United States summary, the expenditure figures shown on the ""local, total"" lines and the combined state-local total lines (opposite each state's name) exclude duplicative intergovernmental transactions.  Thus, the ""local, total"" lines include intergovernmental payments only to the state government and the combined state-local total lines exclude all intergovernmental payments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
