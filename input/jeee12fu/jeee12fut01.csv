"a/The total lines for each criminal justice activity, and for the total justice system, exclude duplicative intergovernmental amounts. This was done to avoid the artificial inflation that would result if an intergovernmental expenditure of a government were tabulated and then counted again when the recipient government(s) expended the amount. The intergovernmental expenditure lines are not totaled for the same reason.",,,,,,,
