Notes:
Justice Expenditure and Employment Extracts tables were previously published in a format with nested column titles and row labels. 
These tables have single-cell column titles and row labels with all relevant identifying information contained therein. 
In order to view full column title and row labels, users can adjust the size of columns or rows and/or use the wrap text function to view the entire text contained in each cell. 
Additionally, blank columns and rows that did not contain data were removed. 
Therefore, data will not be located in the exact same cells as previous versions of the JEEE tables.
Users should be aware of these changes in the format of tables.
