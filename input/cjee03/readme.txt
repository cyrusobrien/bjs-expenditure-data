2003 JUSTICE EXPENDITURE AND EMPLOYMENT EXTRACTS PROGRAM NCJ 212350	

This zip archive contains tables in individual .csv spreadsheets 	
from the 2003 Justice Expenditure and Employment Extracts (CJEE 	
Extracts) and .txt files providing supporting documentation. 	

Note: In 2003, the Finance survey had a smaller sample that did not support State by type estimates.  This made it impossible to produce tables 3, 4, and 8 for 2003 Justice Expenditure and Employment Extracts. For 2004 and beyond, thos tables will return.


Text files:	

CJEEHIST.TXT - 	an overview of the BJS Justice Expenditure and Employment series since 1971.
CJEEMETH.TXT - 	a description of how the data were collected, reviewed and adjusted.  It presents data limitations and how the data may differ from other sources.
CJEEDEF.TXT  - 	definitions of terms and concepts used in the spreadsheets,  including definitions of types of governments, population used, and governmental expenditure, employment, and functions.
CJEECOMP.TXT - 	important comparability issues between the CJEE Extracts data and data from the CJEE Surveys that the CJEE Extracts program replaced.
