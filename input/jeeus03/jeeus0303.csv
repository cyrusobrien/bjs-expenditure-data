"Notes: Detail may not add to total because of rounding. Local government data are estimates subject to sampling variability. The total figure for each justice activity, and for the total justice system, exclude duplicative intergovernmental amounts. Artificial inflation would result if an intergovernmental expenditure of a government were tabulated and then counted again when the recipient government(s) spent the amount. The intergovernmental expenditure lines are not totaled for the same reason.",,,,,
